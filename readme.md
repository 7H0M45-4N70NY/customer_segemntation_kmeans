# K-Means Clustering using R for E-commerce Customer Segmentation

## Overview

This project utilizes K-means clustering in R to analyze e-commerce customer data and create meaningful customer segments. Leveraging the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) technique, the project categorizes customers into distinct clusters, providing actionable insights for marketing strategies.

## Methodology

### Data Analysis
- Explored and analyzed the e-commerce customer data to understand trends using libraries such as `ggplot`, `dplyr`, `factoextra`, `reshape2`, etc.
- Employed the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for segmentation using K-means.

### Customer Segmentation
- Identified distinct customer segments:
  - **Cluster 1: New/Passing By (Silver)**
  - **Cluster 2: Best Customers (Platinum)**
  - **Cluster 3: Loyal Customers (Gold)**
  - **Cluster 4: Losing Customers (Bronze)**

### Recommendations for Segments
- Provided tailored recommendations for each segment to enhance customer engagement and retention based on their characteristics and behaviors.

## Usage

### Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- `kmeans`
